        These properties would normally be set during the MSBuild evalution phase, so you'd
        expect them to go in a .props file. However, we're using a Task to retrieve the
        GitHub repo details, and you can only run tasks in a Target. So we have to
        set all these NuGet properties during the Target execution phase. We make this
        run before Compile because the Compile Target runs some code generation tasks
        that will in some circumstances attempt to use some of these properties.

        Although this is the GitHub-specific package, the basic Endjin.RecommendedPractices
        detects the presence of a Git repo and determines the org and project names as
        part of that, so we just depend on the _EndjinSetGitHubProperties task from that
        package and use its outputs here to set the relevant NuGet package properties.
