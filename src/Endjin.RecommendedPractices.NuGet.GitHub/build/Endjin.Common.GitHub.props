            All the other GitHub-related properties depend on the outputs of the EndjinDetectGitHub
            Target from the Endjin.RecommendedPractices package, so they can't be set in
            a properties file - Targets don't run until after the property evaluation stage has
            completed.
            This is on the only property that we can set up front.
