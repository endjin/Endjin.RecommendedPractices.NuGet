            As of v2, we no longer presume use of GitHub. However, we want to detect when a project
            is using GitHub but has not switched to the Endjin.RecommendedPractices.GitHub package.
            In most cases, we expect that to be a mistake caused by developers not knowing that
            when they upgrade from v1 to v2, they need to change the reference if they want the
            same behaviour. We want to issue a warning when this seems to have happened.
            To be able to detect when a project is hosted on GitHub, we use the tasks package
            that the GitHub sourcelink packages also use. This is a development dependency, so
            it doesn't have any impact on project output.
