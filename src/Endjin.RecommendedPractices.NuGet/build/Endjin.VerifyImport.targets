<!--
    Certain project properties (notably RootNamespace) are sensitive to exactly when you choose to set
    them, with the effect that we need at least one of our .props files to be evaluated at the top
    of the csproj. There's no way to do that today with the NuGet build artifacts mechanism, so
    we have to required projects to import one of our files explicitly.

    This file's purpose is to check that they've done that, and to tell them how to modify their
    csproj if they've not done it yet.
