<!--
    Certain project properties (notably RootNamespace) are sensitive to exactly when you choose to set
    them, with the effect that we need at least one of our .props files to be evaluated at the top
    of the csproj. There's no way to do that today with the NuGet build artifacts mechanism, so
    we have to required projects to import one of our files explicitly.

    This file's purpose is to check that they've done that, and to tell them how to modify their
    csproj if they've not done it yet.

            To workaround an issue when using this package with GitHub Dependabot, we need to ensure that this forced error
            condition is not triggered when Dependabot is checking for updated packages.  As part of this process it generates
            a temporary project file which includes all the package references, but is missing the additional metadata
            needed as part of this package.  As a result this triggers this error condition.

            We have limited options for detecting when running inside the dependabot-updater process, so we are currently
            relying on detecting the filename of the temporary project it creates - 'Project.csproj'.  This is obviously far
            from ideal, but should be adequate for our use cases since it is very unlikely we would have a solution we care
            about containing a project of this name.
